# OMSCS
A living compendium of coding projects completed as part of the Georgia Tech computer science master's program. 

Overview
------
* **CS8803: GPU Hardware and Software**: GPU hardware architecture, warp scheduling, memory and cache architecture, GPU simulators, CUDA, compilers, PTX, SASS, IR, branch divergence, matrix and tensor compute units. Projects include CUDA kernels (matrix multiplication, optimized bitonic sort) in C++, Macsim GPU simulator implementations in C++, and Python programs for handling branch divergence in SASS instructions.
* **CS7632: Game AI**: Grid lattice and game world discretization, path networks, path planning, search algorithms including A*, navmesh construction, steering behaviors, animation, coordinated movement, ballistics and projectiles, decision making, rule-based systems, finite state machines, behavior trees, fuzzy logic, learning (N-grams, naive Bayes, Q-learning), camera control, and procedural content generation. Projects include grid construction and lattice navigation, path network construction and navigation, implementing A*, navmesh creation, ballistic targeting and shot selection, implementing dodgeball agent AI with finite state machines, implementing racecar AI with fuzzy logic, and procedural content generation. All projects were implemented in C# using the Unity game engine.
* **CS6035: Introduction to Information Security**: HTTP and man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, binary exploitation, REST API security, Log4Shell exploits, malware analysis, RSA cryptography, and database security. Projects involved capture the flag-style exercises that included PCAP analysis with Wireshark, performing binary exploits with gdb in assembly, accessing REST API endpoints with Postman, malware analysis with Joe Sandbox, implementing encryption algorithms in Python, and generating Log4Shell exploits in a Linux VM.

Upcoming
------
Future planned courses include:
* **CS6340: Software Analysis**: static and dynamic analysis, compilers, LLVM, software testing, and debugging. Projects will involve implementations in C, C++, Typescript, Java, and KLEE.
* **CS8001-OFL: Federated Learning and Machine Learning Operations**: a seminar covering decentralized model training, privacy, security, and MLOps frameworks used for the deployment and management of federated learning models.
