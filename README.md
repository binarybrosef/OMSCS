# OMSCS
A living compendium of coding projects completed as part of the Georgia Tech computer science master's program. 

Overview
------
* **CS8803: GPU Hardware and Software**
  * **Topics**: GPU hardware architecture, warp scheduling, memory and cache architecture, GPU simulators, CUDA, compilers, PTX, SASS, IR, branch divergence, matrix and tensor compute units.
  * **Projects**: CUDA kernels (matrix multiplication, optimized bitonic sort) in C++, Macsim GPU simulator implementations in C++, and a Python program for handling branch divergence and register tainting in SASS instructions.
* **CS7632: Game AI**
  * **Topics**: Grid lattice and game world discretization, path networks, path planning, search algorithms including A*, navmesh construction, steering behaviors, animation, coordinated movement, ballistics and projectiles, decision making, rule-based systems, finite state machines, behavior trees, fuzzy logic, learning (N-grams, naive Bayes, Q-learning), camera control, and procedural content generation.
  * **Projects**: grid construction and lattice navigation, path network construction and navigation, A*, navmesh creation, ballistic targeting and shot selection, dodgeball agent AI with finite state machines, vehicle AI with fuzzy logic, and procedural content generation. All projects were implemented in C# using the Unity game engine.
* **CS6035: Introduction to Information Security**
  * **Topics**: HTTP and man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, binary exploitation, REST API security, Log4Shell exploits, malware analysis, RSA cryptography, and database security.
  * **Projects**: capture the flag-style exercises including PCAP analysis with Wireshark, binary exploits with gdb in assembly, REST API endpoint security with Postman, malware analysis with Joe Sandbox, encryption algorithm implementations in Python, and Log4Shell exploits in a Linux VM.

Upcoming
------
Future planned courses include:
* **CS6340: Software Analysis**: static and dynamic analysis, compilers, LLVM, software testing, and debugging. Projects will involve implementations in C, C++, Typescript, Java, and KLEE.
* **CS8001-OFL: Federated Learning and Machine Learning Operations**: a seminar covering decentralized model training, privacy, security, and MLOps frameworks used for the deployment and management of federated learning models.
